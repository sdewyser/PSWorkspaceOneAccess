PSWorkspaceOneAccess
üìã Overview
The PSWorkspaceOneAccess PowerShell module simplifies interactions with VMware Workspace ONE Access. It offers a set of functions to manage OAuth authentication and token retrieval for various Workspace ONE Access operations. This module is particularly useful for administrators and developers integrating Workspace ONE capabilities into their automation workflows.

üõ†Ô∏è Features
Open-WS1AccessConnection: Establishes an OAuth connection using client credentials and retrieves an access token.
Get-WS1MagicToken: (Coming Soon) Generates a one-time login (Magic Token) for user authentication within Workspace ONE.
üì¶ Requirements
PowerShell 5.1 or later
Internet access to connect to Workspace ONE Access API
Client credentials (Client ID and Client Secret) for Workspace ONE API
üîß Installation
Clone this repository or download the PSWorkspaceOneAccess.psm1 file directly.

shell
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PSWorkspaceOneAccess.git
Import the module in your PowerShell session:

powershell
Copy code
Import-Module ./PSWorkspaceOneAccess/PSWorkspaceOneAccess.psm1
Optionally, add the module to your PowerShell profile for automatic import:

powershell
Copy code
echo 'Import-Module ./PSWorkspaceOneAccess/PSWorkspaceOneAccess.psm1' >> $PROFILE
üöÄ Usage
1. Open-WS1AccessConnection
The Open-WS1AccessConnection function retrieves an OAuth access token using client credentials.

Parameters:
-ClientId (string): The client ID for the Workspace ONE Access API.
-ClientSecret (string): The client secret for the Workspace ONE Access API.
-AccessURL (string): The base URL for Workspace ONE Access (e.g., access.workspaceone.com).
Example:
powershell
Copy code
# Retrieve an access token
$token = Open-WS1AccessConnection -ClientId "myClientId" -ClientSecret "mySecret" -AccessURL "access.workspaceone.com"

# Output the token
Write-Output "Access Token: $token"
If the connection fails, an error message will be displayed, and the function will return null.

2. (Coming Soon) Get-WS1MagicToken
This function will generate a Magic Token for user authentication in Workspace ONE Access. Stay tuned for updates.

üìö Examples
Example 1: Using the Access Token
Once you have the access token, you can use it to authenticate API requests to Workspace ONE Access:

powershell
Copy code
$token = Open-WS1AccessConnection -ClientId "myClientId" -ClientSecret "mySecret" -AccessURL "access.workspaceone.com"

# Use the token in an API call
$headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $token" }
$response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://access.workspaceone.com/SAAS/jersey/manager/api/v1/user" -Headers $headers -Method Get

# Display the response
$response
Example 2: Error Handling
Handling a failed token retrieval:

powershell
Copy code
$token = Open-WS1AccessConnection -ClientId "invalidClientId" -ClientSecret "invalidSecret" -AccessURL "invalid.url"

if (-not $token) {
    Write-Error "Failed to retrieve access token. Please check your credentials and URL."
}
üêû Known Issues
Invalid Client ID or Secret: If incorrect credentials are provided, the connection will fail with an error message.
Network Connectivity: Ensure your network allows connections to the Workspace ONE Access API URL.
üí° Tips
Store your ClientId and ClientSecret securely using PowerShell's credential manager or environment variables.
Use -Verbose with functions for additional output during debugging.
